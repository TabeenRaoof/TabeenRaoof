The projects below are part of the 25 projects that I worked on for my Harvard CS50 Course


**Project 1: Readability Classifier**

- Classifies a piece of text (paragraph, etc.) into 16 grades based on its difficulty level
- The program determines the difficulty level based on numbers of letters in each word, numbers of words and number of sentences in the text. 
- It makes the computation using the Coleman-Liau index. 

Languages & Frameworks: Python


**Project 2: Stockbroker Simulator**

- This is a project to find the person that stole a duck (CS50â€™s duck to be specific)
- The thief should be looked for using SQL to query through multiple tables of large and small datasets.
- The queries used were from simple to more complex including nested queries, joining 2-3 tables etc.

Languages & Frameworks: SQL

**Project 5: Breakeven Calculator**
